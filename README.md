# eclassParser
An eClass participant parser that will allow you to see the people that are in two of your classes.
This was created to satisfy my curiosity of seeing how many people were in two or more of my classes. 

To use:

Go to your class on eClass.

Select the Participants link.

At the bottom of the page, make sure to select Show all ###

Right click, view page source, copy and paste all to a textfile.
